# SVM Analysis of Fisher Iris Dataset

This project utilizes MATLAB for Support Vector Machine (SVM) analysis on the Fisher Iris dataset. It includes MATLAB source code for training an SVM model, a detailed HTML report explaining the code, and an image file displaying the SVM analysis results.

## Files

- `svm_analysis.m`: MATLAB script containing the SVM analysis code.
- `code_breakdown.html`: Report written in HTML format, explaining the MATLAB code and displaying the results.
- `results.png`: Image file showing the results of SVM analysis.
- `DecisionBoundary.m`: MATLAB script for visualizing the decision boundary of the SVM model.
- `Outliers.m`: MATLAB script for analyzing outliers in the dataset.
- `MulticlassBoundaries.m`: MATLAB script for visualizing decision boundaries in a multiclass SVM.

## Acknowledgment

# SVM Analysis of Fisher Iris Dataset

This project utilizes MATLAB for Support Vector Machine (SVM) analysis on the Fisher Iris dataset. It includes MATLAB source code (`svm_analysis.m`) for training an SVM model and a report (`code_breakdown.html`) written in HTML format, explaining the code and displaying the results. Additionally, there's an image file (`results.png`) showing the SVM analysis results.

## Files

- `svm_analysis.m`: MATLAB script containing the SVM analysis code.
- `code_breakdown.html`: Report written in HTML format, explaining the MATLAB code and displaying the results.
- `results.png`: Image file showing the results of SVM analysis.
